The editor has the capability of loading and saving the text files.
It supports 26 letters of English alphabet (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9),
 space and punctuation marks ( . , : ; ! ? - * + ). Other characters cannot be used and they are ignored.

The words should not be split between two lines. Paragraphs
(ending with return) can be more than one line.

The editor supports cursor movement in four directions, character
insertion or deletion at a desired location. It has also two writing modes: insert and overwrite (default mode: insert).
